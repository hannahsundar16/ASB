In that case, the request would be:\n\n(market_data_api): {"symbol": "HA", "action": "history", "period": "1y", "interval": "1d"}\n\nThis will provide the historical stock data for Hawaiian Holdings for the past year, which can then be analyzed for any potential red flags.'},

The market_data_api can provide real-time data but may not be able to analyze the data for improvement. The paper_trade_api is used for buying and selling stocks and does not have the capability to analyze stock data. \n\nAfter analyzing the data, I can provide more specific insights into the stock\'s performance and potential areas for improvement. However, without the actual data, I can only suggest using the stock_data_reader tool to analyze the data. \n\nIf you have the stock symbol for Frontier Group, we could also use the market_data_api to get the current price, history, or trends of the stock.
